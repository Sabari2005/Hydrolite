# HydroEnergen - Evergreen energy conversion technique

The Raindrop Energy Conversion System is an innovative solution designed to harness the kinetic energy of rainwater and convert it into electrical energy using piezoelectric transducer technology. This project aims to provide a sustainable, decentralized approach to electricity generation, particularly suited for regions with heavy rainfall and abundant water resources. By leveraging the impact energy of falling raindrops, the system addresses the need for renewable energy sources while reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
